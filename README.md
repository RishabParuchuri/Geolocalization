# 🌍 Image-Based Geolocation with CNNs

Predict geographic location from images using Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning.

## 🔧 Features
- Uses pretrained CNNs (e.g. ResNet) via Keras
- Classifies images by location (e.g. city/region)
- End-to-end notebook for training and evaluation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, PIL, ImageIO
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Mount Google Drive & load data
2. Preprocess images
3. Fine-tune pretrained model
4. Train & evaluate on labeled dataset
